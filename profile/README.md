## Our Projects

### EYE TEST KFR V1

At Eye Tech LK, we have developed a groundbreaking software application called **EYE TEST KFR V1**. This unique application leverages the science of Iridology and Mathematics to analyze kidney function. All you need to get started are clear, properly photographed images of both irides, and our software will provide reliable results.

### EYE TEST KFR 2020

**EYE TEST KFR 2020** represents the evolution of our pioneering non-invasive kidney function analysis software. Building upon the success and innovation of **EYE TEST KFR V1**, this advanced version sets new standards in the field of biomedicine. It combines the principles of Iridology science and advanced mathematical analysis to provide a comprehensive and highly accurate assessment of kidney function.

Key Features:

- **Enhanced Accuracy:** EYE TEST KFR 2020 boasts an impressive accuracy rate of 94%, setting it apart as a highly reliable tool for kidney function analysis. The software has been fine-tuned to deliver precise results, making it an invaluable resource for medical professionals and researchers.

- **Data Refinement:** Our team has worked tirelessly to refine the data processing algorithms, ensuring that the software produces the most detailed and useful information. The software's ability to interpret the information from iris images has been greatly improved.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** EYE TEST KFR 2020 features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to a wide range of users, from healthcare practitioners to individuals interested in monitoring their kidney health.

- **Non-Invasive Assessment:** Just like its predecessor, EYE TEST KFR 2020 remains non-invasive. It requires only clear, properly photographed images of both irides to perform a comprehensive analysis of kidney function, eliminating the need for invasive tests and procedures.

- **Cutting-Edge Biomedicine:** EYE TEST KFR 2020 represents the forefront of biomedicine, utilizing digital technology to provide insights and data that were previously difficult to obtain without invasive measures. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way kidney health is assessed and monitored.
